    <p class="mainstory">Yesterday afternoon, members of the center of disease control confirmed that the water supply heading
        to capital hill was laced with top grade LSD. Things were running normally within the first hour but shortly after everyone in congress 
        decided to get into a circle and <span class="congress">"Hash things out".</span> There was crying, hugging, bongo drums and medical grade marjiuana being passed around.
        After there circle they decided to continue the days work by demanding the executive branch follow the constituion and wait for congressional approval
        to eneter war. They also passed a law titled the "lets stop being dicks act" which stopped funding to the NSA and DHS, it also forces the federal government to
        show exactly how much money is taken from tariffs

    <p>We talked to NY senator<span class="congress"> Chuck Shumer </span>and got his take on the new laws. He commented "I mean, I have no idea why we did these mean and hurtful things in the first place. The public
        trusts us to represent there interests and we only have served ourself. Oh I feel so gulity, it doesn't matter how far you run, in the end youll always run into yourself. 
        Look, a rainbow; isn't it beautiful." President Trump has said he will not pass any new legislation that was passed yesterday, saying they were not in the right mind, Chuck Shumer
        replied "your not in the right mind man".</p>

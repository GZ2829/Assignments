        <p class=ship>LANGLEY, VA- A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office Of The Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
        
        <p class=ship>According to the report, sections of the documents- "almost invariably the most crucial passages"- are marred by an indelgible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agencys inception in 1947.</p>
        
        <p class=ship>CIA Director Porter Gross lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the paticulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
        
        
       <ul>
        <li>the Cold War</li>
        <li>the civil rights movement</li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
